## Hi, I'm Bintone 👋

<div align="center">
  
✨ A few years ago, I hit refresh on my career and moved from business analyst to software developer. Along the way, I discovered a passion for data - diving deep into numbers, uncovering hidden stories, and solving puzzles with code.

👩🏻‍🎓 After completing my Computer Science Higher Diploma, I recently graduated with first-class honours in my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence.

🤓 I am currently seeking internships or junior positions in the fields of Data Analytics, Data Science, and AI, where I can challenge my skills and grow professionally!
