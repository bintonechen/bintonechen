## Hi, I'm Bintone 👋

✨ Couple of years ago I decided to transition my career from personal training to IT.
👩🏻‍🎓 I graduated in Computer Science, and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence. 
🤓 I recently discovered a strong interest in data analytics, and now working on advancing my skills in both data analytics and software development.
