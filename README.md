## Hi, I'm Bintone 👋

<div align="center">
  
✨ A couple of years ago I decided to transition my career from personal training to Software Development.

👩🏻‍🎓 I graduated in Computer Science, and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence.

🤓 I am actively seeking internship or junior positions in software development and data analytics, where I can challenge my skills and grow professionally!
