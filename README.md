## Hi, I'm Bintone 👋

<div align="center">
  
✨ A couple of years ago I decided to transition my career from personal training to IT.

👩🏻‍🎓 I graduated in Computer Science, and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence.

🤓 I recently discovered a strong interest in data analytics and am now looking for opportunities in this field.
